# Unique Edge

## Existing approaches
A lot of vibe tooling focuses on generating code faster. That solves prototyping speed, but not reliability, trust, or submission readiness.

## What we do differently
Vibe Sentinel focuses on shipping credibility:

- deterministic repo scoring across usefulness, impact, execution, innovation
- actionable roadmap prioritized by severity and effort
- beginner-first `coach` mode with plain-English fix cards
- optional `--apply-safe` scaffolding for missing baseline files

## Why this matters
Builders of any skill level can go from rough prototype to judge-ready repo quickly, with less guesswork and fewer demo-day failures.
