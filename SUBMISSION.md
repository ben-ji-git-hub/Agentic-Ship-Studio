## One-line Pitch
Vibe Sentinel is a beginner-friendly agentic shipping console with a visual GUI that audits vibe-coded repos, explains fixes in plain English, and safely scaffolds missing submission essentials.

## Why this is useful
It prevents common prototype-to-demo failures by checking docs, tests, CI, security, and submission readiness in one deterministic workflow.

## Why this is different
The new `agent-pack` + `ship` workflow translates findings into executable agent task queues, per-task prompt files, and a full shipping sequence with safe baseline scaffolding.
