00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,426
Vibe Sentinel is the reliability layer for agent-built projects.

2
00:00:04,426 --> 00:00:11,065
Instead of shipping a prototype and hoping it passes review, you run one repeatable loop.

3
00:00:11,065 --> 00:00:15,933
Audit quality, prioritize fixes, execute the ship sequence, and re-check.

4
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:19,031
The dashboard is designed for beginners first.

5
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:24,785
It starts with guided actions, plain-language coaching, and a clear score story.

6
00:00:24,785 --> 00:00:31,866
The tutorial page markets the workflow in under a minute, so new users understand value immediately.

7
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:38,505
The artifacts page keeps every output in one place, including reports, prompts, and submission assets.

8
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:43,816
The OpenClaw page exposes bridge-ready actions for agent orchestration over HTTP.

9
00:00:43,816 --> 00:00:48,242
Together, these pages make the product both explainable and operational.

10
00:00:48,242 --> 00:00:55,324
You get faster iteration, more credible submissions, and a cleaner handoff between humans and coding agents.
