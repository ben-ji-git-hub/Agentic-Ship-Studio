00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,249
Welcome to Vibe Sentinel, the agentic reliability layer for fast-moving project teams.

2
00:00:04,249 --> 00:00:10,131
In the next four minutes, I will show the complete workflow from first audit to submission-ready output.

3
00:00:10,131 --> 00:00:16,341
The goal is simple: keep the speed of vibe coding, but remove the risk of shipping a fragile demo.

4
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:18,301
We start on the Tutorial page.

5
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:20,916
This page is intentionally concise and marketing-forward.

6
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:28,106
A beginner can immediately understand the product promise, the three-step loop, and the value they will get in the first run.

7
00:00:28,106 --> 00:00:34,969
The score cards show a realistic before-and-after story, and the call to action moves directly into the working dashboard.

8
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:36,603
Now we open the Dashboard.

9
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:39,544
This is the operational home for the full lifecycle.

10
00:00:39,544 --> 00:00:42,159
At the top, we set a project path.

11
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:44,446
Then we use the beginner lane first.

12
00:00:44,446 --> 00:00:50,656
Run Audit is the baseline check, and Launch Ship Sequence is the one-command path to improve project quality.

13
00:00:50,656 --> 00:00:53,924
Everything else can stay hidden until the user is ready.

14
00:00:53,924 --> 00:00:56,212
I start the built-in beginner tutorial.

15
00:00:56,212 --> 00:01:01,767
This creates a guided sequence with visible progress, so new users know exactly what to do next.

16
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:02,421
No guessing.

17
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:04,055
No reading long docs first.

18
00:01:04,055 --> 00:01:07,323
Just a concrete path from zero to an improved score.

19
00:01:07,323 --> 00:01:09,284
Now we run the baseline audit.

20
00:01:09,284 --> 00:01:13,206
Vibe Sentinel scans the repo and scores usefulness, impact, execution, and innovation.

21
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:18,108
It also identifies practical blockers like missing tests, weak documentation, absent CI, and artifact gaps.

22
00:01:18,108 --> 00:01:20,396
The point is not to produce noise.

23
00:01:20,396 --> 00:01:23,337
The point is to create an ordered, fixable plan.

24
00:01:23,337 --> 00:01:27,259
After the audit finishes, we scroll through the score breakdown and recommendations.

25
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:32,488
You can immediately see where the project is weak and what actions provide the highest lift.

26
00:01:32,488 --> 00:01:38,697
This is critical in hackathon settings, where teams do not have time to manually triage dozens of quality issues.

27
00:01:38,697 --> 00:01:42,292
Next, I enable advanced actions and run them one by one.

28
00:01:42,292 --> 00:01:45,560
Agent Pack turns findings into structured tasks for coding agents.

29
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,502
Coach generates beginner-friendly fix cards in plain language.

30
00:01:48,502 --> 00:01:52,423
Roadmap generates a practical sequence so improvements happen in the right order.

31
00:01:52,423 --> 00:01:55,365
These outputs reduce context switching between humans and agents.

32
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,652
Now we launch the full Ship Sequence.

33
00:01:57,652 --> 00:02:03,208
This orchestrates the complete improvement loop:
audit, task generation, coaching, roadmap, safe starter files, and re-check.

34
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:07,457
Instead of running multiple commands manually, teams execute one workflow and keep momentum.

35
00:02:07,457 --> 00:02:11,705
This is where Vibe Sentinel becomes a true killer app for agentic development.

36
00:02:11,705 --> 00:02:14,647
After Ship Sequence completes, we start Demo Tour mode.

37
00:02:14,647 --> 00:02:18,568
Demo Tour automatically highlights the narrative flow for recordings and live presentations.

38
00:02:18,568 --> 00:02:23,144
It gives you a stable, repeatable story:
score story, findings, tasks, artifacts, and timeline.

39
00:02:23,144 --> 00:02:27,065
That means less presentation chaos and a more credible demo under pressure.

40
00:02:27,065 --> 00:02:29,353
Now we move to the Artifacts page.

41
00:02:29,353 --> 00:02:31,314
This page is focused and fast.

42
00:02:31,314 --> 00:02:36,870
You can refresh artifacts from audit, run ship plus refresh, and preview generated outputs in one place.

43
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,445
Everything needed for judges is centralized:
report files, coaching output, roadmap, and agent prompts.

44
00:02:41,445 --> 00:02:43,733
No hunting through folders while screen sharing.

45
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:46,674
From here, I trigger another refresh and ship cycle.

46
00:02:46,674 --> 00:02:50,923
This shows that the flow is repeatable, not a one-time scripted success.

47
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:53,864
A reliable process is the real differentiator in competitions.

48
00:02:53,864 --> 00:02:55,498
Anyone can generate code quickly.

49
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:58,113
Far fewer teams can prove consistent execution quality.

50
00:02:58,113 --> 00:03:00,073
Next we open the OpenClaw page.

51
00:03:00,073 --> 00:03:03,342
This is the bridge for external agent orchestration over HTTP.

52
00:03:03,342 --> 00:03:08,571
I set the project path, probe bridge status, and run an action through the bridge endpoint.

53
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:12,492
You can also copy cURL or JSON request payloads for automation workflows.

54
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:15,760
This makes Vibe Sentinel useful beyond a single UI session.

55
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,048
Finally, we return to the Tutorial page.

56
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:20,663
This closes the loop between discoverability and execution.

57
00:03:20,663 --> 00:03:26,218
The tutorial communicates the value clearly, and the studio proves it with real outputs and score movement.

58
00:03:26,218 --> 00:03:35,696
If you are building with coding agents, this is the core advantage:
Vibe Sentinel gives you deterministic checkpoints, structured handoff, and submission-ready artifacts without slowing down creative velocity.

59
00:03:35,696 --> 00:03:37,003
You still build fast.

60
00:03:37,003 --> 00:03:38,637
You just ship with confidence.

61
00:03:38,637 --> 00:03:46,154
For teams preparing a final submission, this is the practical advantage:
you can demonstrate strategy, execution quality, and repeatability in a single flow.

62
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:47,788
The tutorial explains the system.

63
00:03:47,788 --> 00:03:49,095
The dashboard drives improvements.

64
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:50,402
Artifacts prove the output.

65
00:03:50,402 --> 00:03:52,037
OpenClaw enables external agent control.

66
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:57,266
That end-to-end structure is what turns a fast prototype into a credible product story.

67
00:03:57,266 --> 00:03:59,880
Thank you for watching this Vibe Sentinel walkthrough.
