00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,511
Welcome to Vibe Sentinel, the agentic reliability layer for fast-moving project teams.

2
00:00:05,511 --> 00:00:13,142
In the next four minutes, I will show the complete workflow from first audit to submission-ready output.

3
00:00:13,142 --> 00:00:21,196
The goal is simple: keep the speed of vibe coding, but remove the risk of shipping a fragile demo.

4
00:00:21,196 --> 00:00:23,740
We start on the Tutorial page.

5
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:27,131
This page is intentionally concise and marketing-forward.

6
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:36,458
A beginner can immediately understand the product promise, the three-step loop, and the value they will get in the first run.

7
00:00:36,458 --> 00:00:45,360
The score cards show a realistic before-and-after story, and the call to action moves directly into the working dashboard.

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,480
Now we open the Dashboard.

9
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,295
This is the operational home for the full lifecycle.

10
00:00:51,295 --> 00:00:54,687
At the top, we set a project path.

11
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:57,654
Then we use the beginner lane first.

12
00:00:57,654 --> 00:01:05,709
Run Audit is the baseline check, and Launch Ship Sequence is the one-command path to improve project quality.

13
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:09,948
Everything else can stay hidden until the user is ready.

14
00:01:09,948 --> 00:01:12,916
I start the built-in beginner tutorial.

15
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:20,122
This creates a guided sequence with visible progress, so new users know exactly what to do next.

16
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:20,970
No guessing.

17
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,090
No reading long docs first.

18
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,329
Just a concrete path from zero to an improved score.

19
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:29,873
Now we run the baseline audit.

20
00:01:29,873 --> 00:01:34,960
Vibe Sentinel scans the repo and scores usefulness, impact, execution, and innovation.

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,319
It also identifies practical blockers like missing tests, weak documentation, absent CI, and artifact gaps.

22
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:44,286
The point is not to produce noise.

23
00:01:44,286 --> 00:01:48,102
The point is to create an ordered, fixable plan.

24
00:01:48,102 --> 00:01:53,189
After the audit finishes, we scroll through the score breakdown and recommendations.

25
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:59,972
You can immediately see where the project is weak and what actions provide the highest lift.

26
00:01:59,972 --> 00:02:08,026
This is critical in hackathon settings, where teams do not have time to manually triage dozens of quality issues.

27
00:02:08,026 --> 00:02:12,690
Next, I enable advanced actions and run them one by one.

28
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,929
Agent Pack turns findings into structured tasks for coding agents.

29
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:20,744
Coach generates beginner-friendly fix cards in plain language.

30
00:02:20,744 --> 00:02:25,831
Roadmap generates a practical sequence so improvements happen in the right order.

31
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:29,647
These outputs reduce context switching between humans and agents.

32
00:02:29,647 --> 00:02:32,614
Now we launch the full Ship Sequence.

33
00:02:32,614 --> 00:02:39,821
This orchestrates the complete improvement loop:
audit, task generation, coaching, roadmap, safe starter files, and re-check.

34
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:45,332
Instead of running multiple commands manually, teams execute one workflow and keep momentum.

35
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:50,843
This is where Vibe Sentinel becomes a true killer app for agentic development.

36
00:02:50,843 --> 00:02:54,658
After Ship Sequence completes, we start Demo Tour mode.

37
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:59,746
Demo Tour automatically highlights the narrative flow for recordings and live presentations.

38
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:05,681
It gives you a stable, repeatable story:
score story, findings, tasks, artifacts, and timeline.

39
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:10,768
That means less presentation chaos and a more credible demo under pressure.

40
00:03:10,768 --> 00:03:13,735
Now we move to the Artifacts page.

41
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:16,279
This page is focused and fast.

42
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:23,486
You can refresh artifacts from audit, run ship plus refresh, and preview generated outputs in one place.

43
00:03:23,486 --> 00:03:29,421
Everything needed for judges is centralized:
report files, coaching output, roadmap, and agent prompts.

44
00:03:29,421 --> 00:03:32,388
No hunting through folders while screen sharing.

45
00:03:32,388 --> 00:03:36,203
From here, I trigger another refresh and ship cycle.

46
00:03:36,203 --> 00:03:41,714
This shows that the flow is repeatable, not a one-time scripted success.

47
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:45,530
A reliable process is the real differentiator in competitions.

48
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,649
Anyone can generate code quickly.

49
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:51,041
Far fewer teams can prove consistent execution quality.

50
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,584
Next we open the OpenClaw page.

51
00:03:53,584 --> 00:03:57,824
This is the bridge for external agent orchestration over HTTP.

52
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:04,607
I set the project path, probe bridge status, and run an action through the bridge endpoint.

53
00:04:04,607 --> 00:04:09,694
You can also copy cURL or JSON request payloads for automation workflows.

54
00:04:09,694 --> 00:04:13,933
This makes Vibe Sentinel useful beyond a single UI session.

55
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:16,901
Finally, we return to the Tutorial page.

56
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:20,292
This closes the loop between discoverability and execution.

57
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:27,499
The tutorial communicates the value clearly, and the studio proves it with real outputs and score movement.

58
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:39,793
If you are building with coding agents, this is the core advantage:
Vibe Sentinel gives you deterministic checkpoints, structured handoff, and submission-ready artifacts without slowing down creative velocity.

59
00:04:39,793 --> 00:04:41,488
You still build fast.

60
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:43,608
You just ship with confidence.
