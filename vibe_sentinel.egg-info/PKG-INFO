# Vibe Sentinel

Build fast. Ship credible.

`vibe-sentinel` is a Vibeathon-focused reliability layer for vibe-coded projects. It audits your repo, predicts judging readiness, and gives you a beginner-friendly fix path.

## Positioning

Most projects in vibe competitions optimize for generation speed. Vibe Sentinel optimizes for shipping confidence: clear docs, test coverage, CI proof, safe secrets handling, and demo readiness.

## Problem

Vibe-coded prototypes often look impressive but fail during evaluation because basics are missing:

- unclear onboarding
- no reproducible setup
- no automated checks
- weak submission artifacts

## Solution

Vibe Sentinel provides a clear loop:

1. Audit quality and submission readiness.
2. Turn findings into prioritized actions.
3. Generate beginner coaching cards with exact next steps.

## Core Features

- Weighted audit across `usefulness`, `impact`, `execution`, and `innovation`.
- Secret leak detection for common API/token patterns.
- Template scaffolding for `SPEC.md`, `DEMO_SCRIPT.md`, `SUBMISSION.md`, and `UNIQUE_EDGE.md`.
- Prioritized roadmap generation from audit findings.
- **New: Beginner Fix Coach (`coach`)**

## New Differentiating Feature: Beginner Fix Coach

`vibe-sentinel coach` converts technical findings into plain-English action cards.

Why this matters:

- Beginners get concrete "do this now" steps.
- Each finding includes why it matters and how to verify the fix.
- Optional `--apply-safe` mode creates missing starter files (tests, CI, and submission templates) without overwriting existing work.

## Installation

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

## Quickstart

```bash
vibe-sentinel init
vibe-sentinel audit . --output-dir .vibe-sentinel
vibe-sentinel coach --report .vibe-sentinel/report.json --output .vibe-sentinel/coach.md --project .
```

## Commands

```bash
vibe-sentinel init
vibe-sentinel audit . --output-dir .vibe-sentinel
vibe-sentinel roadmap --report .vibe-sentinel/report.json --output .vibe-sentinel/roadmap.md
vibe-sentinel coach --report .vibe-sentinel/report.json --output .vibe-sentinel/coach.md --project .
vibe-sentinel studio --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765
```

## Visual GUI: Studio

Launch the local visual interface:

```bash
vibe-sentinel studio
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8765`.

Studio gives you:

- Animated score dial and category breakdown
- One-click `Audit`, `Coach`, and `Roadmap`
- **Agentic Auto-Improve** (runs full cycle + safe starter file generation)
- Artifact tracking for reports and generated markdown

## Submission-Ready Flow (Judge-Friendly)

Run this from a clean clone:

```bash
python -m pip install -e . && \
  vibe-sentinel init && \
  vibe-sentinel audit . --output-dir .vibe-sentinel && \
  vibe-sentinel coach --report .vibe-sentinel/report.json --output .vibe-sentinel/coach.md --project . --apply-safe && \
  vibe-sentinel roadmap --report .vibe-sentinel/report.json --output .vibe-sentinel/roadmap.md
```

Expected output artifacts:

- `.vibe-sentinel/report.json`
- `.vibe-sentinel/report.md`
- `.vibe-sentinel/coach.md`
- `.vibe-sentinel/roadmap.md`
