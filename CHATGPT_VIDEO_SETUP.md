# ChatGPT Video Production Setup

Use this guide to turn your recording into a polished submission fast.

## 1) Start a dedicated ChatGPT thread

Open ChatGPT and start a new thread titled:

`Vibe Sentinel Vibeathon Video Producer`

Paste this first:

```text
You are my video producer for a 4:30 product demo.
Goal: maximize clarity, trust, and perceived execution quality for judges.
Constraints:
- Keep language concrete and non-hyped.
- Keep script within 4:30 spoken pace.
- Preserve technical accuracy.
- Focus on benefits visible on screen.
I will provide the script and plan next.
After each response, give me:
1) revised copy
2) what to say while clicking
3) one risk to avoid
```

## 2) Paste current assets

Paste in this order:

1. `DEMO_SCRIPT.md`
2. `VIDEO_DEMO_PLAN.md`
3. Baseline + post-ship score numbers from terminal

## 3) Ask for teleprompter version

```text
Convert this into a teleprompter-ready script.
Requirements:
- One short sentence per line.
- Add [PAUSE] and [CLICK] cues.
- Keep total runtime 4:20 to 4:40.
- Preserve technical details and exact feature names.
```

## 4) Ask for rehearsal coaching

```text
Act as a speaking coach.
Create a 10-minute rehearsal plan with:
- 3 warm-up drills
- 3 likely stumble points
- corrected phrasing for each stumble point
- pacing targets by timestamp
```

## 5) Ask for title, description, and chapters

```text
Generate:
1) 5 video title options (no hype words)
2) YouTube/Loom description (120-180 words)
3) chapter timestamps for a 4:30 runtime
4) one-line value proposition for submission form
```

## 6) Ask for caption file draft

```text
Create clean captions from the teleprompter script.
Format:
- timestamped blocks suitable for SRT editing
- no line over 42 characters if possible
- preserve product names exactly
```

## 7) Final QA pass (after rough cut)

If ChatGPT supports file uploads in your session, upload the rough MP4 and ask:

```text
Review this rough cut like a Vibeathon judge.
Score from 1-10 on:
- clarity
- differentiation
- proof of execution
- beginner accessibility
Then list:
1) top 5 edits by impact
2) exact lines to trim or replace
3) final 15-second closing line
```

If upload is unavailable, paste a timestamped outline and request the same review.

## 8) Final deliverables checklist

- [ ] Teleprompter script finalized
- [ ] Description + chapters finalized
- [ ] Captions drafted
- [ ] Final QA edits applied
- [ ] Video URL copied into `SUBMISSION.md`
