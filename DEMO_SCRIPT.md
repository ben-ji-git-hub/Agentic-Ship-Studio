# Vibe Sentinel Final Demo Script (4:30)

Use this as the single source of truth for narration.

## 0:00 - 0:20 Hook

**On screen:** Studio hero and controls.

**Voiceover:**  
"Most vibe-coded projects look good in a screenshot, then fail under judge scrutiny because reliability basics are missing. Vibe Sentinel is an agentic shipping console that closes that gap."

## 0:20 - 0:45 Product framing

**On screen:** Point to `Run Audit`, `Generate Agent Pack`, `Run Coach`, `Build Roadmap`, and `Launch Ship Sequence`.

**Voiceover:**  
"This tool runs one practical loop: detect issues, convert them into agent tasks, scaffold safe fixes, and re-check quality. The output is both beginner-friendly and automation-ready."

## 0:45 - 1:10 Baseline audit

**On screen:** Enter demo project path and click `Run Audit`.

**Voiceover:**  
"Here is our realistic baseline: low score, missing tests and CI, plus weak submission readiness. This is the exact state many hackathon repos start in."

## 1:10 - 1:35 What-If Score Simulator

**On screen:** Toggle 2-3 items in `What-If Score Simulator`.

**Voiceover:**  
"Before touching code, the simulator forecasts score lift from specific fixes. This makes prioritization obvious for beginners and removes guesswork for teams."

## 1:35 - 2:05 Killer app: Agent Pack

**On screen:** Click `Generate Agent Pack`, preview `agent_pack.md` and `agent_tasks.json`.

**Voiceover:**  
"This is the killer app. Findings become a severity-ordered task queue with prompt files for coding agents. No manual triage, no ambiguous TODO list."

## 2:05 - 2:55 Ship sequence

**On screen:** Click `Launch Ship Sequence` with safe apply on. Let timeline and history animate.

**Voiceover:**  
"Now Vibe Sentinel runs the complete ship loop: audit, agent pack, beginner coach, roadmap, and re-audit. It applies only safe baseline files and never overwrites existing work."

## 2:55 - 3:25 Milestones and celebration

**On screen:** Show score jump, milestone unlock cards, and celebration animation.

**Voiceover:**  
"Milestone tracking turns quality into visible progress. Teams can communicate readiness clearly: baseline, shipping threshold, and gold-level quality."

## 3:25 - 3:55 Coach clarity

**On screen:** Click `Run Coach` and scroll `coach.md` preview.

**Voiceover:**  
"Most tools stop at detection. Coach mode explains each finding in plain English with concrete next steps and verification commands."

## 3:55 - 4:15 Demo Tour mode

**On screen:** Click `Start Demo Tour` and let panel highlighting run.

**Voiceover:**  
"Demo Tour auto-highlights the storyline so recording stays calm and consistent, even under time pressure."

## 4:15 - 4:30 Close

**On screen:** Final frame on score dial + timeline + artifacts.

**Voiceover:**  
"Vibe Sentinel helps teams move from prototype speed to shipping confidence through one repeatable, agentic workflow."
