# Signal Garden (Prototype Brief)

Signal Garden is a prototype that turns an unstructured list of tasks into a calm, focused day plan.

## Product idea

- Ingest a short JSON inbox
- Assign urgency + effort tags
- Build an ordered list of "focus blocks"

## Why this is a good demo target

- Realistic code structure (not toy single-file)
- Intentional quality gaps so Vibe Sentinel can improve score quickly
- Clear before/after story for a 3-5 minute video
